## zstd

[zstd / Zstandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd) is a compression algorithm from Facebook(now Meta) developed by Yann Collet at around  ~2015-2016.

Not gonna lie, but `zstd` is kinda cool to me.

Why ?

Because it is a lot faster than some compression algorithms like `gzip` while still maintaining the same compression ratio. I kind of feel bad that I only got to know about this today, while skimming through the internet to see how I can reduce the size of the `*.tar.gz` file that I created. I usually use `gzip` because I haven't really had a reason to look out for options to be honest.

`gzip` is based on the [DEFLATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) format that uses a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding.

## Tests
I've even done a small test to see which performs better b/w `gzip` & `zstd`.

### Environment
I used a `wsl2` environment. I used [hg-engine](https://github.com/BluRosie/hg-engine) git repository for testing.

I had run some builds and other stuff inside this git repository and the total size is around **1.8 GiB**.

```bash
du -sh hg-engine/
1.8G    hg-engine/
```

|System specs||
|------|-------|
|**OS**| Debian GNU/Linux bookworm 12.8 x86_64 (WSL2)|
| **Processor** | AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (12) @ 3.29 GHz|
|**Ram**| 7.43 GiB|

I'm going to try and compress this directory by both `gzip` and `zstd` using single thread.

### Results

|-| gzip| zstd |
|----| :-------------: |:-------------:|
|**Size**| 537 MiB      | 300 MiB |
|**Time**|   56 secs    | 27 secs |

## Conclusion

From this very basic and small test, you could see that `zstd` performed extremely well in terms of both the size of the final compressed file and the time taken to compress.

I know that I should have tested this more thoroughly like,

- Multiple threads
- varying compression levels
- Decompression time

And a lot...

For modern hardware, `zstd` seems to be the most suitable one. And I'm going to use `zstd` a lot :)
