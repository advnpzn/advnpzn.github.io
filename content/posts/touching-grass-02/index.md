# WHAT? AGAIN ?!

YES :)

For those who didn't get it, please read [touching grass part 1](https://advnpzn.github.io/posts/touching-grass-01/)

This time, everything wasn't fully planned, and the visit was for around 3 days and we travelled a lot more different places across many districts (not that many).

# Why?

We didn't decide this just for the sake of travelling and exploring different places. This just happened to be a byproduct or excuse to travel. The main reason was for a colleague's relative's wedding. We took it as a reason to travel few places and then attend the wedding afterwards.

# Planning.

Well, I just now said we didn't plan a lot for this, but to be honest, we actually did. Not a lot, but we did.

- Booked train tickets from Villupuram -> Tirunelveli

    We booked a normal sleeper berth since we will be traveling at night and reaching in the morning anyways.

- Booked train tickets from Tirunelveli -> Chennai

    We booked [Vande Bharat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Bharat_Express), this will the first time experiencing this train.

Basically we had to book all these ~1 month prior to the travel date so that the reservation can be confirmed.


# Here we go..

We met at [Villupuram Railway Junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villupuram_Junction_railway_station) on a Friday to board the first train from there to [Tirunelveli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villupuram_Junction_railway_station) at night around 10:30 PM.


### Something didn't go as we thought..

When we boarded and searched for our place, we noticed that other people were sleeping in (2/3) seats. Yes we were 3 dudes. Upon asking the guy who
was sleeping in my seat, he immediately realised and went to his seat. So no worries there. But in my friend's seat, another person was present and he replied that they were a couple and one of them got allotted to a different compartment and it would be hard for them to stay separated.
