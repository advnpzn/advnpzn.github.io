# Introduction
Do you use C++?

Do you struggle with maintaining dependencies for your projects?

Is it taking too much time to setup your C++ development environment setup ?

If **YES**, then consider that your development workflow is going to become smooth after reading this post.

One of the things where we bang our heads when dealing with C++ is managing third party dependencies that we use in our projects.
Be it a seasoned user or a novice, everyone must have tackled this issue somewhere at sometime using different ways.

But is there a thing as which one's the "best" way ?

Ofcourse, there isn't, but anything that makes me not bang my head against the table, I would consider it a better way.
And this is where we'll be talking about Package Managers, and specifically about `vcpkg`.

# vcpkg
[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) is a package or dependency manager for C++. It's very unfortunate that there is no official package manager for C++ at it's dawn. I am not sure if the concept of "package managers" even existed 

## Installation

It's pretty easily actually.

We'll be focusing on GNU/Linux installation entirely. This applies for usage as well. I'll be using Debian 12.
But 90% of the times, it's pretty much the same in Microsoft Windows.

Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

Run the script

```bash
cd vcpkg && ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

You can add `-disableMetrics` as an arugment to the shell script, if you don't want Microsoft to spy on you.

Then if you want to run `vcpkg` from anywhere in your shell, you can add the PATH to your `.bashrc` or profile file.
``` shell
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
export PATH=$VCPKG_ROOT:$PATH
```

After this, you can probably run `vcpkg` from any directory.

## Usage

Now to come to the part where we actually use `vcpkg` in our C++ project. I'll use a demo project.

### Demo Project

We will be using [`fmt`](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library to print something.

`main.cxx`
```cpp
#include <fmt/core.h>

int main() {
  fmt::print("Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!\n");
  
  return 0;
}
```

And to build this project, we'll be using CMake.

So, our initial project directory would look like this.
```
demo/
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── main.cxx
```

Now from our `demo` directory, do 
```bash
vcpkg new --application
```

This would create two new files in our `demo` directory.
* `vcpkg.json` - The file where we define our dependencies.
* `vcpkg-configuration.json` - the file where we define how `vcpkg` behaves, such as which custom registry to use etc.

The above way of initialising & using `vcpkg` is called as **Manifest Mode**.

There are 2 modes generally.
* Classic
* Manifest

We'll be using Manifest mode throughout this post, because it is BETTER!

Now, to add a dependency to our project, which is `fmt`,
```bash
vcpkg add port fmt
```
You can search for many packages at https://vcpkg.io/en/packages.

Now, if you open that `vcpkg.json` file, you can see that the dependency we added is present.
```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    "fmt"
  ]
}
```

### CMakeLists.txt

Make sure you have `cmake` installed beforehand along with something like `make` or `ninja`. Since this is a small demo project, we can have the following in our demo project.

`CMakeLists.txt`
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)

project("demo")

find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(demo "main.cxx")
```

Now, obviously, when you run this,
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
```
you'll be getting an error.

Now to use vcpkg with CMake, we need the CMake to use the vcpkg CMake toolchain file (`vcpkg.cmake`) when we configure our CMake against our `CMakeLists.txt` file.

We can do this by specifying the path to the toolchain file using `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to pass the path to the `vcpkg.cmake` file.
This can be done in many ways. But for now, we will use this as an argument with CMake command.

Delete the existing `build` directory.
Then, do
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Now this would actually use `vcpkg` to build the dependencies specified, and at the end it also shows how to utilise the dependency in your `CMakeLists.txt` file.

```
The package fmt provides CMake targets:

    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt)

    # Or use the header-only version
    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt-header-only)
```

After this configuration, we can try building.
```bash
cmake --build build
```

This above command would probably output the following.
```
-- Running vcpkg install
Detecting compiler hash for triplet x64-linux...
Compiler found: /usr/bin/c++
All requested packages are currently installed.
Total install time: 1.12 us
The package fmt provides CMake targets:

    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt)

    # Or use the header-only version
    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt-header-only)

-- Running vcpkg install - done
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /home/mito/demo/build
[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/demo.dir/main.cxx.o
[100%] Linking CXX executable demo
[100%] Built target demo
```

Looks like the binary `demo` was built.
Let's try running it.
```bash
./build/demo
```
```bash
Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!
```

It works!

Now this is far better than manually downloading the source code of the library, building it, using the header files in your src, etc..
