## `Telegram`

For those who has never heard of this word, let me tell you what it is. [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org) which in short is called 'Telegram' is an internet instant messaging app.

One could talk to their contacts through Telegram if they also happen to have that app. One could create/join groups, channels where they could chat with others and share anything. So, basically it's pretty much like any other instant messaging app.

### How I came to know about Telegram

Like, how every tale goes, once upon a time, I was very bored and all I had at the moment was my dad's android smartphone with me in the house. I used to play games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans and so on... In a word, It was the golden era for android games ðŸ”¥ where you could find quality games. I was going through the Google Play Store looking for something to download. This is where I got recommended to download this app called "Telegram". I knew it was an instant messaging app, but never used it before. I assumed it would be similar to Facebook/Whatsapp, so downloaded it to check out what it's all about.

### First time Experience

Ok, so I have downloaded the app
