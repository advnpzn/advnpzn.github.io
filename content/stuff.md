### akinator [`python`, `telegram`, `bot`]
A Telegram bot that I created to play Akinator guessing game in Telegram itself (Unofficial tho, don't sue me üò≠üôè). It kinda got [popular](https://t.me/BotsArchive/2285) at some point. Currently it is offline, because hosting it is costly üòû.

### neco-arc dvd logo [`c++`, `sfml`]
This is something that I made for fun when I was too bored. There is this character called [Neco-Arc](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Neco-Arc) in an Anime series that I used to watch.

I thought what if I replaced the DVD Logo in an usual DVD Logo Screensaver with this character. So that's what I did using C++ and SFML Graphics Library.

### caeservis [`c++`, `sfml`]
I was learning about Caesar Cipher in my Cryptography class at College. I thought what if I did Caesar Cipher on every individual pixel of an Image. And this is the result of it.
