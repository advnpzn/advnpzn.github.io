### Akinator [`Python`, `Telegram`, `Bot`]
This was a Telegram bot that I created to play Akinator guessing game in Telegram itself. It kinda got [popular](https://t.me/BotsArchive/2285) at some point. Currently it is offline. because hosting it is too much costly ðŸ˜ž.

### Neco-Arc DVD Logo [`C++`, `SFML`]
This is something that I made for fun when I was too bored. There is this character called [Neco-Arc](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Neco-Arc) in an Anime series that I used to watch.

I thought what if I replaced the DVD Logo in an usual DVD Logo Screensaver with this character. So that's what I did using C++ and SFML Graphics Library.

### CaesarVis [`C++`, `SFML`]
I was learning about Caesar Cipher in my Cryptography class at College. I thought what if I did Caesar Cipher on every individual pixel of an Image. And this is the result of it.

### AssaultCube Trainer [`C++`, `WIN32 API`]
I was learning about game hacking and most of the tutorials suggested me to start with an open source game called [AssaultCube](https://assault.cubers.net/). So, as part of my learning, I made a [Trainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainer_(games)#:~:text=Game%20trainers%20are%20programs%20made,in%20order%20to%20allow%20cheating.) (Cheat Tool) to have unlimited ammo, health, fly hack etc..
