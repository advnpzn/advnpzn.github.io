<p>For those who has never heard of this word, let me tell you what it is. <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram Messenger</a> which in short is called &lsquo;Telegram&rsquo; is an internet instant messaging app.</p>
<p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Telegram_2019_Logo.svg/121px-Telegram_2019_Logo.svg.png" alt="Telegram 2019 Logo.svg"  /></p>
<p>One could talk to their contacts through Telegram if they also happen to have that app. One could create/join groups, channels where they could chat with others and share anything. So, basically it&rsquo;s pretty much like any other instant messaging app.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-came-to-know-about-telegram">How I came to know about Telegram</h3>
<p>Like, how every tale goes, once upon a time, I was very bored and all I had at the moment was my dad&rsquo;s android smartphone with me in the house. I used to play games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans and so on&hellip; In a word, It was the golden era for android games üî• where you could find quality games. I was going through the Google Play Store looking for something to download. This is where I got recommended to download this app called &ldquo;Telegram&rdquo;. I knew it was an instant messaging app, but never used it before. I assumed it would be similar to Facebook/Whatsapp, so downloaded it to check out what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<h3 id="first-time-experience">First time Experience</h3>
<p>Ok, so I have downloaded the app, registered for an account using my mobile number. At first it was empty, there&rsquo;s nothing there, if one of my contacts has this app, then it would show up there on the personal section. I could then start chatting with my contacts on Telegram if I want.</p>
<p>No one in the contacts was using Telegram, so it was basically empty. There&rsquo;s pretty much nothing in the app. üòü</p>
<h3 id="what-i-found">What I found</h3>
<p>So, I was pretty underwhelmed and asked myself, <em>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;</em>. There must be something else there that I&rsquo;m missing. So, I tried looking at every nook and corner of the app, this is when I found the <code>search</code> function of the app.</p>
<p>Ok, I am over exaggerating this. The function was just right in front of me in the home page itself. I searched <code>'Movies'</code>, and guess what? It showed me a bunch of channels with the name <code>'Movies'</code>. When I clicked one of them, I was presented with movie files that was uploaded to that on a regular basis.</p>
<p>üéâÔ∏è We found piracy!!</p>
<p>This is when I started to look into Telegram a bit more.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-stayed">Why I stayed</h3>
<p>Initially, piracy is the sole reason. I had limited internet (mobile internet) and these channels offered movies at lower sizes. Also to avoid the traditional way of pirating movies off the internet.</p>
<p>Okay, you might ask what is that &ldquo;Traditional Way&rdquo;.
That traditional way of mine is basically,</p>
<ul>
<li>You open the browser</li>
<li>Search for a piracy site to download your movie</li>
<li>Open the site</li>
<li>Look for your movie</li>
<li>Click the <code>Download</code> button.</li>
<li>Oops, Guess what? That was a FAKE <code>Download</code> button and you are now presented with 3-4 pop up tabs/ads.</li>
<li>Clear all these ads,</li>
<li>Carefully, click the <code>Download</code> button.</li>
<li>Realise the movie file size is more than the Bandwidth offered by your Internet Plan.</li>
<li>Go back to the search engine.</li>
<li>Repeat Bullet Point 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, who wants to go through this hell. At that time, there wasn&rsquo;t any adblockers that I know of.</p>
<p>Telegram, <em>*cough</em>* *<em>cough</em>*, I mean the channels that upload these files to telegram offer 1 click way to download these files. Just go to the channel, click the file and it will start downloading. Look, how simple that is.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/why-i-use-telegram/assets/simple.gif" type="" alt="simple"  /></p>
<h3 id="why-i-really-stayed">Why I really stayed</h3>
<p>Piracy was not the sole reason I stayed in Telegram till now and continue to do so. As time went on, I got better Internet in terms of both speed and bandwidth and also, I learned about Torrent <strong>üòà</strong>. Now pirating stuff from Telegram is viewed by me as a lowly thing to do, since I got the superior Torrent :)</p>
<p>There was a time while I was exploring several groups, I came to know about the concepts of <strong>Bots</strong> in Telegram. I got hooked at first site. Imagine an account, that you could program to automate any tasks, well yes, it can. So, I got into some programming groups such as <code>@python</code>, Telegram Bot Library Groups like <code>@pythontelegrambot</code>, <code>@pyrogram</code>, <code>@telethon</code>. Started learning python (I already knews the basics). Got into advanced topics. Now, I started developing bots for telegram. Followed examples here and there, literally wacthed youtube videos and typed everything as they typed in that video, all kinds of stuff. But, once I got the hang of it and familiarised myself with that API wrapper, I was getting good at it. I made several bots, most of it are offline for now. You can check out <a href="https://t.me/aki_akinator_bot">Akinator-Bot</a> which I consider one of my most successful bots. It even got <a href="https://t.me/BotsArchive/2285">Bot of the Week</a> award in the <a href="https://t.me/BotsArchive">BotsArchive</a> channel.</p>
<p>I guess, I still stay on telegram because I like the programming community there. Made lots of acquaintances, laughed together, shit on others together, memed together and it was fun and it still is.</p>
<p>Also, I like the the unlimited storage that they are giving. I mean the popular messaging platform &ldquo;Discord&rdquo; offers like 8 MiB per file lol. Meanwhile, Telegram offers, if I remember correctly, it&rsquo;s around 1.5 GiB per file. The difference is insane.</p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">me, trying to understand how people use apps without unlimited cloud storage ü§î <a href="https://t.co/fvzNtZkXcp">pic.twitter.com/fvzNtZkXcp</a></p>&mdash; Telegram Messenger (@telegram) <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1629118956404412418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2023</a></blockquote>


<h3 id="what-i-dislike">What I dislike</h3>
<p>There are a lot of things I dislike, like there are a lot of &ldquo;crypto bros&rdquo; in the platform, who will try their hard to make you to invest in some obscure never ever heard of coin. They are annoying.</p>
<p>And I have a slightly negative view on the Introduction of Premium plan to telegram. I mean, if they really are low on money, then it&rsquo;s perfectly okay to give users premium plan. For me, it&rsquo;s too costly, and most of the feature is just used for flexing to others except that increase in size of per file for uploading and unrestricted upload/download speed.</p>
<p>Telegram doesn&rsquo;t have E2E (End to End) Encryption by default for Groups and Channels and they use their own in-house encryption protocol, the MTProto. E2E encrytion is supported for private messages if and only if you enable Secret Chats. I know most people say this point as one of the negative points of telegram. I somewhat I agree with that along with the fact that only the client side is opensource. Well, I don&rsquo;t blame them, it&rsquo;s how it is.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Telegram is growing at a fast rate in the category of instant messaging. That means people took a liking to Telegram and what it offers to its users (I hope it&rsquo;s not piracy üëÄÔ∏è). Telegram is here to stay for the foreseeable future.</p>
