<p>One could talk to their contacts through Telegram if they also happen to have that app. One could create/join groups, channels where they could chat with others and share anything. So, basically it&rsquo;s pretty much like any other instant messaging app.</p>

<p>Like, how every tale goes, once upon a time, I was very bored and all I had at the moment was my dad&rsquo;s android smartphone with me in the house. I used to play games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans and so on&hellip; In a word, It was the golden era for android games ðŸ”¥ where you could find quality games. I was going through the Google Play Store looking for something to download. This is where I got recommended to download this app called &ldquo;Telegram&rdquo;. I knew it was an instant messaging app, but never used it before. I assumed it would be similar to Facebook/Whatsapp, so downloaded it to check out what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
